1. PURPOSE

HVB is a library / programming platform in C++ designed to help you
with everyday tasks of scientific computing: linear algebra, simple
graphics, simple text processing, graph manipulation, numerical
optimization, creating PostScript and other graphics files, etc.


2. INSTALLATION

For full working you will need the following libraries, including the
development files:

* BLAS & LAPACK
* X11
* Imlib2

For example, in ubuntu, apply the following command:

>> sudo apt-get install g++ libblas3 libblas-dev liblapack3 liblapack-dev libx11-dev libimlib2 libimlib2-dev

In other UNIX systems the packages may have different names.

Now enter the examples directory and try:

>> make xtest
